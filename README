The contents of this repository are solutions to problems that I have been assigned during the course of several graduate level courses in AI at the University of Florida. The code is intended to reveal the paths I took to solve these problems and do not represent a peer-reviewed, critiqued, and certainly not bug-free solutions.

Feel free to borrow from the ideas here, but be very careful as to how closely you follow my solution and always be sure you are mindful of your own school's academic honesty policies.
